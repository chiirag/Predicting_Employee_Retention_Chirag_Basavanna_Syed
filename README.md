# Predicting Employee Retention

## Introduction
Employee retention is a key concern for organizations, especially in the technology sector. High attrition rates impact productivity, increase hiring costs, and disrupt team dynamics. This project aims to build a **logistic regression model** to predict employee retention based on various factors, helping companies proactively retain valuable employees.

## Business Objective
Traditionally, companies have focused on **reactive** measures like exit interviews to understand employee turnover. However, a **predictive approach** enables HR teams to:
- Identify **early warning signs** of attrition.
- Understand the **key factors** influencing employee retention.
- Develop **data-driven strategies** to improve workforce stability.

## Dataset
The dataset is stored as a **CSV file** and includes:
- **Employee demographics** (age, gender, education, etc.).
- **Job-related details** (role, department, performance ratings).
- **Compensation & benefits** (salary, bonuses, incentives).
- **Work-life balance** (overtime hours, commute distance).
- **Employment conditions** (company size, innovation opportunities).
- **Target variable**: Indicates whether an employee has left the company.

## Approach
This project follows a structured analytics workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning missing values and formatting data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Identifying patterns in retention.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting important variables for modeling.
4. **Model Building** - Developing a **logistic regression** model.
5. **Evaluation** - Assessing model accuracy and performance metrics.
6. **Business Recommendations** - Providing actionable strategies for retention.


## Expected Outcomes
- **A trained logistic regression model** for predicting employee attrition.
- **Data-backed insights** on why employees leave vs. why they stay.
- **Recommendations** to optimize HR strategies for retention.
